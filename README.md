# dressupgame
```
Our project revolves around a dress-up game where the primary feature of the program is taking a custom character and “dressing them up” with accessories.
In this program, we would have character classes that contain attributes for each clothing component.
The user would be able to add or modify components as they see fit.
One of the benefits of this program is that the difficulty of the project can be increased if needed -
for example, you could implement a “save file” that tells the program to print out a .txt file containing information readable by the program which acts like a save,
and you can provide this same .txt file the next time you run the program in order to restore your previous progress.
Another suggestion could be to assign monetary values to the accessories using dictionaries and adding another layer of depth to the project.
It’s definitely an original idea and one of the advantages of this project is its strong flexibility.
